		The first link titled "A Brief History of Skateboarding" mentions how skateboarding has changed throughout the centuries. It includes details about different kinds of skateboarding as well as how the skateboard itself has changed. The second link shows some of my favorite skate videos that I have ever watched, and the third link shows some videos of my own skateboarding. Enjoy!
